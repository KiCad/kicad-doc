KiCad Documentation Status Report
=================================

Introduction
------------

Initially this was meant as an email then it grew out of control...

Greetings
---------

Hello everybody!

I am writing now to testify that the documentation effort is not dormant
nor over. I am investigating all the doc format in use to document
programs out there. There are plenty, everyone with pros and cons. The
effort is taugher than I could imagine but I do not despair and so you
should not! You have to forgive me because I have been painfully slow in
the search and test of these tools: almost all the tools were new to me.
Doing this search I have learned much and discovered a very interesting
world that was new to me and I have to thank the KiCad team for this.

Status
------

This is the current status of my efforts:

1) I have successfully converted Cvpcb manual from odt to asciidoc, rest
and markdown (markdown with some limitations). The converted versions
have a nice automatically generated TOC. In the while I have discovered
that old odt files, presumably once converted from staroffice files,
could contains "strange" image format like "StarView MetaFile".
Presumably other doc file have the same images inside. No problem: they
are easily converted into png, though through a manual procedure.

2) I have successfully created the nationalized .po files from the source
docs.

3) I have successfully created outputs from merging the translation with
the reference documents.

Thus so far we have just to decide which lightweight markup format to
choose which best fits our documentation needs. This is a great start to
compare them all:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language

in particular:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language#Comparison_of_language_features

Let's start the comparison (easier to read first):

[options="header"]
|=========================================================================================
| markup   | easy to read | footnotes | tables | indexes | translation | books generation
| asciidoc |   best       |    yes    |   yes  |   yes   |  using po4a | using docbook(direct)
| markdown |   good       |  no/yes   | no/yes | no(yes) |  using po4a | using docbook
| rest     |   good       |    yes    |   yes  |   yes   |   native    | using docbook(direct)
|=========================================================================================

My choice
---------

Bear in mind that probably these are _very_ personal considerations. I am aware of it.

The format I prefer: asciidoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"AsciiDoc is a human-readable document format, semantically equivalent to
DocBook XML, but using plain-text mark-up conventions." from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc[wikipedia]

Pros:

* one of the cleaner format
* sufficient powerful: it supports table/table formatting/index/references
* plenty of tools available: pandoc(haskel), asciidoc(python), asciidoctor(ruby)
* support on websites like github: just write a README.adoc and other
  supports are planned (like https://www.gitbook.io/[gitbook])
* actively developed tools
* in the future there will probably be a direct pdf conversion tool _without_ the need of the docbook burden
* there is even a nice asciidoc GUI editor, AsciidocFX: http://www.asciidocfx.com/

Cons:

* there are some formats to or from asciidoc direct conversion tool
  missing. I have converted, for an example, ODT into rest and then rest to
  asciidoc. Since rest is almost equipotential and have a unambiguous syntax
  (since rest _is_ a real standard) the rest to asciidoc conversion (trough
  wonderful pandoc) is flawless.
  This is an (incomplete) list:
  ** odt -> asciidoc:
   *** odt (odt2rest)-> rest
   *** rest (pandoc)-> asciidoc
  ** asciidoc -> rest:
   *** asciidoc -> html
   *** html(pandoc)->rest

Second choice: rest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pros:

- almost complete: it supports table/index/reference/etc.
- plenty of tools available: pandoc(haskel), sphinx(python), docutils(python)
- actively developed tools (all)
- widely used: it is the standard for python documentation, CMake, etc.
- you can (trough pandoc) convert almost anything to rest (apart
  asciidoc) and rest into anything (with pandoc, sphinx or docutils)
- many web (python) platforms use rest as an internal format for texts.
  See Zope/Plone, Trac, etc.
- nice gui editor, http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/[Retext], with
  realtime preview

Cons:

- some formatting options are missing:
  ** table formatting: table dimensions, column dimensions, cell justification, etc.
  ** you cannot have text bold _and_ italics
  ** you cannot decide where to put toc and other things
- not (arguably) immediate (but still easy) syntax. See the links or the
  comments and such.
- support for i18n is native but more complex to handle than po4a
- support for i18n in sphinx is a work-in-progress state and actually
  have some quirks that, hopefully, will be resolved with the next sphinx
  version (wrong position of intermediate (.mo) files, fuzzy strings not 
  handled, Makefile do not have any option about i18n, and so on)

What I suggest to avoid (and why)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/[markdown]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

pros:

* much used today, probably due to its simplicity
* easier to integrate with documentation tools that already produce
  markdown as output as doxygen does
* the git flavoured format is simple and powerful enough to handle easily
  all documentation needs as tables (with cell justification), implicit 
  links, and such.

cons:

* despite its popularity I do not think that could be a good choice for
  these reasons:
  ** it is not a standard: just as an example pandoc supports some 5
     incompatible markdown "flavours":
     *** markdown: its pandoc own markdown superset format
     *** markdown_github: github supeset format
     *** markdown_mmd: multimarkdown superset format
     *** markdown_phpextra: php superset format
     *** markdown_strict: the *least common multiple* format
  ** markdown common subset is too poor to be used at anything apart from
     html pages. This is its aim and there finishes its use.
     See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Standardization. Markdown
     original converter is defined _abandonware_. Its development cycle
     lasted 1 year 9 years ago.
  ** its syntax is easier than rest but somehow arguably not easier than
     asciidoc: see links, images and tables for some examples

http://txt2tags.org/[txt2tags]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wonderful small and powerful piece of software.

pros:

* one sigle portable python executable;
* exportable in many formats, and thanks to
  http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/[pandoc] even more;
* completeness: the format should have all the necessary characteristics
  for the needs of a considerable complex and complete documentation task;
* diffusion. There are essentially two implementation:
  ** txt2tags: its native executable whose development seems stopped by
     the year 2010. This is not always a bad thing since if the format is
     fairy complete, its obsolescence is a guarantee of stability;
  ** pandoc: its powerful capability greatly enhance txt2tags output
     formats

cons:

* future: the format must stand the test of time. If the format is
  the result of a one people effort, as in this case, I am afraid it is
  doomed to extinction. On the other hand, as said previously, this is also
  a good thing; depends on which side you see it.

http://redcloth.org/textile[textile]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Very interesting project with a standard, easy and powerful markup
reference. It is very diffused and embedded in many web platforms. It has
many implementations in various languages and it is a pity I haven't
found any way to make it internationalized. It is an alternative to
markdown as some tools/libraries support both.

pros:

* diffused in many web libraries and web apps
* exportable in many formats thanks to http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/[pandoc]

cons:

* somewhat less used then other more popular and substantially equivalent tools
* not easy to handle i18n

*TO COMPLETE*

http://www.sisudoc.org/[sisu]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another interesting and powerful software project with a comprehensive
format specification.

pros:

* complete as docbook or more
* translatable with the aid of po4a

cons:

* no tools to convert automatically document from other formats. No
  support from pandoc.

*TO COMPLETE*


To sum up
---------

* the only documentation standard in full sense is docbook. Almost every
  new format or conversion tool, in a way or another, do refer to
  docbook. This is logical since docbook-xml is derived directly from
  SGML that is a reference and was the reference for many years in the
  publishing field. The problem is that docbook is easy to produce by
  means of some automatic tool but it is not easy to write by humans,
  even with the aid of intelligent editors like emacs or eclipse;

* odt is easy to write, using Libre/OpenOffice but not to maintain and
  translate;

* so we have to switch from odt to some other documentation tool that we
  should choose from among similar tools that have some minimal
  characteristics we need such as:
  ** easier than docbook
  ** complete i.e. with many features like tables, indexes, toc, etc.
  ** standard
  ** more than one implementation (i.e. tools) of the standard
  ** easily translatable (i.e. automatic strings extractions and merge)
  ** tools actively developed

* I am getting acquainted with asciidoc. This document is in fact, full
  asciidoc compliant; try by yourself: copy and past the  exact copy of
  this mail text and type these commands:

 asciidoc this-text.adoc    #convert into html
 a2x -f pdf this-text.adoc  #convert into pdf
 a2x -f epub this-text.adoc #convert into epub


Creating the outputs
--------------------

Common conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To test my experiments I've started converting the easier KiCad document:
cvpcb. To do this, the easiest way I found was to use odt2sphinx, and odt
to rest converter (that was useful for the rest tests too) found
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/odt2sphinx/[here].

Done simply this:

 odt2sphinx cvpcb.odt

Obtained the file _index.rst_ and the images into _images_ folder and
renamed index.rst into cvpcb.rst. Some of these images were in an
obscure obsolete Star View Metafile format. Unoconv does _not_ work well
because convert the entire A4 page with the image inside so I converted
the images in png format manually in this way:

1. loaded with LibreOffice
2. copy & pasted into GIMP
3. exported into PNG
4. search and replace of all references of .svm files into .png in the
   rest file

The rest files obtained are full of small errors. The script adds spaces
randomly, adds unwanted image parameters and do not recognize the
headings but ... the results are very easily corrected manually and with
some sed scripting.

Probably this process could be improved exporting the odt to html first
and then separate the embedded images to external png images via some
script.

Anyway, once obtained a correct rest file with external images it is easy
to convert this file into asciidoc or markdown with wonderful pandoc:

 pandoc -f rst -t asciidoc cvpcb.rst -o cvpcb.adoc

 pandoc -f rst -t markdown cvpcb.rst -o cvpcb.md

Asciidoc output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As I seen above, to create the output files I have to simply do this:

 asciidoc cvpcb.adoc    #convert into html
 a2x -f pdf cvpcb.adoc  #convert into pdf
 a2x -f epub cvpcb.adoc #convert into epub

Rest output
~~~~~~~~~~~

To create output from rest files the best tool to use is
http://sphinx-doc.org/[sphinx]. Included in bundle with the sphinx
distribution there is a nice auto-configuration tool called 
sphinx-quickstart. Just exec this utility to create a configuration file
conf.py and a Makefile to automate the document output generation.
One done to create html simply type:

 make -e html

or

 make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D html_logo=images/kicad_logo.png" html

To include the KiCad logo.

Similarly to create the other outputs:

 make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D latex_logo=images/kicad_logo.png -D latex_paper_size=a4" latexpdf
 make -e SPHINXOPTS="-D epub_cover=\('images/kicad_logo.png', ''\)" epub

Internationalization
--------------------

This one of the most useful things that this document format conversion
will bring: easy internationalization of all documentation. Different
tools bring different approaches.

asciidoc and markdown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tools that use these formats are not able to handle
internationalization directly but there is a beautiful little utility by
Debian: http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/[po4a]

These are the source format supported with the actual 0.45 po4a version:

 po4a-gettextize --help-format

 List of valid formats:
  - asciidoc: AsciiDoc format.
  - dia: uncompressed Dia diagrams.
  - docbook: DocBook XML.
  - guide: Gentoo Linux's XML documentation format.
  - ini: INI format.
  - kernelhelp: Help messages of each kernel compilation option.
  - latex: LaTeX format.
  - man: Good old manual page format.
  - pod: Perl Online Documentation format.
  - sgml: either DebianDoc or DocBook DTD.
  - texinfo: The info page format.
  - tex: generic TeX documents (see also latex).
  - text: simple text document.
  - wml: WML documents.
  - xhtml: XHTML documents.
  - xml: generic XML documents (see also docbook).

Markdown is not listed but _is_ supported. See
http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/man/man3/Locale::Po4a::Text.3pm.php

Please note that if you want to use po4a with Asciidoc you should use
po4a at least version 0.45 or specify the "text" format, as for the
markdown format. For version 0.45, the "text" filter asciidoc option is
deprecated.

Usually working directories are specified in the po4a.cfg (see man po4a)
config file but in the examples that follow I have done without it for
clarity.

The process of internationalization is done in different steps.

Step 1: string template extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For asciidoc

 po4a-gettextize -f asciidoc -M utf-8 -m cvpcb.adoc -p po/cvpcb.pot

or

 po4a-gettextize -f text -o markdown -M utf-8 -m cvpcb.adoc -p po/cvpcb.pot

for markdown.

Step 2: translation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Copy the template into our nationalized version:

 cp po/cvpcb.pot po/it.po

and use the gettext editor you like:

 emacs it.po
 poedit it.po

keep in mind that snapshots images should be nationalized. I suggest to
create a internationalized image dirs such as:

 images
 images-es
 images-fr
 images-it

in this way untranslated images fallback to English images. po4a
correctly translate image reference to enable the fallback.

Step 3: produce internationalized master documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 po4a-translate -f asciidoc -M utf-8 -m cvpcb.adoc -p po/it.po -k 0 -l cvpcb_it.adoc

Step 4: produce all kind of internationalized output formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 asciidoc -a lang=it cvpcb_it.adoc    #convert into html
 a2x -a lang=it -f pdf cvpcb_it.adoc  #convert into pdf
 a2x -a lang=it -f epub cvpcb_it.adoc #convert into epub

Step 5: update translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the following command the .po file will be updated automatically.

 po4a-updatepo -f asciidoc -m cvpcb.adoc -p po/it.po

Step 6: loop
^^^^^^^^^^^^

repeat from step 2


rest (sphinx)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sphinx software suite contains all the tools to handle i18n needs.
Below a step-to-step guide to obtain a nationalized document with sphinx.

Step 1: string template extraction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Extraction of the template constituent of the messages to be translated. Create build/locale/docname.pot

 sphinx-build -b gettext -d build/doctrees source source/catalog

Step 2: adding the languages to the configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add the following variable assignment to conf.py:

 locale_dirs = ['locale/'] # path is example but recommended

Because (perhaps a bug?) I have not found a working way to assign the
variable directly in the sphinx-intl command string.

Step 3: creation/update of the localized strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 sphinx-intl -c source/conf.py update -p source/catalog -d source/locale -l it.

NOTE: due to a unresolved bug, fuzzy strings are not yet handled. It is
suggested to manage fuzzy strings with this command:

 msgmerge -U source/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/cvpcb.po source/catalog/$DOCNAME.pot 

Step 4: translate with the preferred .po files editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 poedit source/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/cvpcb.po
 emacs source/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/cvpcb.po

Step 5: stats about localized strings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 sphinx-intl -c source/conf.py stat -d source/locale -l it.

Step 6: compilation of the translated strings files (.mo)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

sphinx-intl -c source/conf.py build -d source/locale

Step 7: Build nationalized documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

for html:

 sphinx-build -a -b html -d build/doctrees source build/html
 sphinx-build -a -b html -d build/doctrees -D language=it source build/html-it
 sphinx-build -a -b html -d build/doctrees -D language=fr source build/html-fr

for pdf:

 sphinx-build -a -b latex -d build/doctrees -D language='it' source build/latex-it
 make -C built/latex-it pdf-all

for epub:

 sphinx-build -a -b epub -d build/doctrees -D language='it' source build/epub-it

Tools install

Notes
-----

1. I found cover images are a little tricky. For example, using sphinx you
have to specify the same image for the cover with every output format
(epub, html, pdf) in a different way. This is not a big problem but it is
annoying. This is due to the fact that some formats like pdf or epub are
usually produced via docbook. There are some exceptions:

 a. for asciidoc there is one promising project, asciidoctor-pdf, that
hopefully will be able to produce pdf directly but is experimental and
unfortunately it is not able to include images yet.
With asciidoc I have found a hack (thanks to John Beard) for generating
nice cover with images as logos for pdf and epub outputs: +
- for pdf: +
+
 a2x -f pdf --dblatex-opts "-P latex.output.revhistory=0 -P doc.publisher.show=0 -s pdf-cover-dblatex.sty" document.adoc
+
where the content of pdf-cover-dblatex.sty is: +
+
[source,latex]

----
+
DOCTITLE should and could be substituted with a simple sed script like this: +

 b. for rest, as a pdf direct converter I have recently discovered
 http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/[rst2pdf] but its development seems to
 be at a standstill since 2012.

 and does it needs docbook?
