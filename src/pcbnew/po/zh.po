"components. Consequently an intermediate stage is necessary. During this intermediate process "

"In order to maintain the legibility of the _kicad_pcb_ and _pretty_ data files, KiCad prefers "

"or aliases (new method). Since setting environment variables can be cumbersome especially on "
"GUI-based operating systems, the environment variable scheme for supporting model search paths "
"has been extended to make use of KiCad's existing internally defined _Path Configuration_ "
"dialog.  This dialog is available via the _Preferences->Configure Paths_ menu and is shown "
"below. Setting additional paths within this dialog will extend the search paths used to find "
"3D model files.  The dialog does not actually set environment variables but the filename "
"resolution system acts as if it does; in cases where an actual environment variable with the "
"same name is defined, the environment variable's value overrides any internally defined "
"values. File names relative to these defined variables begin with _${MY_ENV_VAR}_ where "
"_MY_ENV_VAR_ is a variable defined via the _Path Configuration_ dialog or an actual "
"environment variable."
