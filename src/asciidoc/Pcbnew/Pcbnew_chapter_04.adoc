Schematic Implementation
------------------------

Linking a schematic to a printed circuit board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally speaking, a schematic sheet is linked to its printed
circuit board by means of the netlist file, which is normally
generated by the schematic editor used to make the schematic. Pcbnew
accepts netlist files made with Eeschema or Orcad PCB 2. The netlist
file, generated from the schematic is usually missing the footprint
modules that correspond to the various components. Consequently an
intermediate stage is necessary. During this intermediate process
the association components/modules is performed. In KiCad, CvPcb is
used to create this association and a file named `*.cmp` is
produced. CvPcb also updates the netlist file using this information.

Cvppcb can also output a “stuff file” `*.stf` which can be back
annotated into the schematic file as the F2 field for each
component, saving the task of re-assigning module footprints in each
schematic edit pass. In Eeschema copying a component will also copy
the footprint assignment and set the reference designator as
unassigned for later auto-incremental-annotation.

Pcbnew reads the modified netlist file `.net` and, if it exists, the
.cmp file In the event of a module being changed directly in Pcbnew
the .cmp file is automatically updated avoiding in this way the
requirement to run CvPcb  again. The following figure illustrate the
whole work-flow of Kicad and how intermediate files are obtained and
used by the different software tools that made Kicad.

Procedure for creating a printed circuit board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After having created your schematic in Eeschema:

* Generate the netlist using Eeschema.
* Assign each component in you netlist file to the corresponding module
(often called footprint) used on the printed circuit using Cvpcb.
* Launch Pcbnew and read the modified Netlist, this will also read the
file with the  module selections.

Pcbnew will then load automatically all the necessary modules.
Modules can now be placed manually or automatically on the board and
tracks can be routed.

Procedure for updating a printed circuit board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the schematic is modified (after a printed circuit board has been
generated), the following steps must be repeated:

* Generate a new netlist file using Eeschema.
* If the changes to the schematic involve new components, the
corresponding modules must be assigned using Cvpcb.
* Launch Pcbnew and re-read the modified netlist (this will also re-read
the file with the module selections).

Pcbnew will then load automatically any new module, add the new
connections and remove redundant connections. This process is called
forward annotation and is a very common procedure when a PCB is made
and updated.

Available options

[cols="1,1"]
|====
| Module Selection
| Components and corresponding footprints on board link:
normal link is Reference (normal option
Timestamp can be used after reannotation of schematic, if the previous
annotation was destroyed (special option)
|Exchange Module:
|If a footprint has changed  in the netlist: keep old footprint or
change to the new one.
|Bad Tracks Deletion
|Keep all existing tracks, or delete erroneous tracks
|Extra Footprints
|Remove footprints which are on board but not in the netlist.
Footprint with attribute "Locked" will not be removed.

Loading new footprints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When new footprints are found in the netlist file, they will be
automatically loaded and placed at coordinate (0,0).

New footprints can be moved and arranged one by one. A better way is to automatically move (unstack) them:

Activate footprint mode (image:../common/icons/mode_module.png[])

Move the mouse cursor to a suitable (free of component) area, and
click on the right button:

* Move New Modules if there is already a board with existing footprints.
* Move All Modules, the first time (when creating a board).

The following screenshot shows the results.
